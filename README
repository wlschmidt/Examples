This repository contains random sample code that I write up to learn stuff or try out something on a small scale.  
It may not all work, could be over simplified, or may not seem to have any cohesive purpose and provide no guarantees that things will work correctly or safely.

	Hello World- typical hello world app just to see what github looks like with code on it.
